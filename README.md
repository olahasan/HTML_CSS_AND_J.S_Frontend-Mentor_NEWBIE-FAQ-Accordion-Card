## Overview

### The challenge

In this challenge, you'll build an FAQ accordion. This is an extremely common front-end pattern, so it's an excellent opportunity to get some practice in!

Your users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone **Use the Tab key to navigate through the questions. Once a question is focused, press the Enter or Space key to toggle the answer**
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive FAQ accordion card. I used CSS animations to create smooth transitions when showing and hiding the answers. I also improved my JavaScript skills by adding event listeners and manipulating the DOM.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my CSS and JavaScript skills by working on more Frontend Mentor challenges. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript frameworks.
